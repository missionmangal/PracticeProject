JobScheduler vs WorkManager ->
=> WorkManager uses JobScheduler service to schedule the jobs. If JobScheduler is not supported
   by the device, then it uses Firebase JobDispatcher service. If Firebase JobDispatcher is not
   available on the device, it will use AlarmManager and BroadcastReceiver.

=> So with WorkManager, you don't need to worry about backward compatibility. In addition to this,
   it allows for defining constraints, which need to be met in order for the job to be run, 
   such as defining network constraints, battery level, charging state and storage level.
