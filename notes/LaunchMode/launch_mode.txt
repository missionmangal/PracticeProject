Intent Launch Mode ::

1. standard ->
=> This is the default mode.
=> The behavior of Activity set to this mode is a new Activity will always be created
   to work separately with each Intent sent. Imagine, if there are 10 Intents sent to 
   compose an email, there should be 10 Activities launch to serve each Intent separately.
   As a result, there could be an unlimited number of this kind of Activity launched in a device.

2.singleTop ->
=> It acts almost the same as standard one which means that singleTop Activity 
   instance could be created as many as we want. Only difference is if there already
   is an Activity instance with the same type at the top of stack in the caller Task, 
   there would not be any new Activity created, instead an Intent will be sent to an 
   existed Activity instance through onNewIntent() method. 
   
3. singleTask ->
=> This mode is quite different from standard and singleTop. An Activity with
   singleTask launchMode is allowed to have only one instance in the system (a.k.a. Singleton). 
   If there is an existed Activity instance in the system, the whole Task hold
   the instance would be moved to top while Intent would be delivered through 
   onNewIntent() method. Otherwise, new Activity would be created and placed in the proper Task. 

4.singleInstance ->
=> This mode is quite close to singleTask, only single instance of Activity could 
   be existed in the system. The difference is Task hold this Activity could have 
   only one Activity, the singleInstance one. If another Activity is called from 
   this kind of Activity, a new Task would be automatically created to place that 
   new Activity. Likewise, if singleInstance Activity is called, new Task would be 
   created to place the Activity.
