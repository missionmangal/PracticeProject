Factory pattern ->

1.  Factory pattern is one of the mmost used design pattern in java. This type of pattern comes under creation pattern as this pattern
    provides one of the best ways to create an object.

2.  In factory pattern, we create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using
    a common interface.

Steps ->
1. Create a interface "Shape"
2. Create classes which implements "Shape" interface (Concreate classes) like  "Circle","Rectangle","Square".
3. override methods inside interface "Shape".
4. Create a class by which we can get interface's instance.->
     create a class ShapeFactory, with a menthod getInstance in which we pass a variable "type".
5. By using type we return the object of Concreat class like "Circle","Rectangle", "Square".

Note -> in factory pattern user doesn't know about the object creation logic. User just get the object inside there are several
        classes which implement the same interface.
