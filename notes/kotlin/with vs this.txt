The with() and the also() functions differ in 3 things.

1.The receiver argument is provided as an explicit parameter T in the case of with(), 
whereas it is provided as an implicit receiver T in the case of also().
The block argument is defined as a function that has an implicit receiver T in the case of with(), 
whereas it has an explicit argument T in the case of also().
The with() function returns what is returned by executing its block argument, whereas the also() 
function returns the same object that was provided as its receiver.
