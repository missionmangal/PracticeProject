Kotlin Scope Functions
 Let , With , Apply
 
Let ->
=> it's a scoping function. Which gives copy of object inside it as "it". We can't assign new value
   to "it". The last statement is returned from the scope.
   
Also ->
=> Unlike let, it returns the original object instead of any new return data. Hence the return data 
   has always the same type.
=> Like let, also uses "it" too.

Apply ->
=> Kotlin apply is an extension function on a type. It runs on the object reference 
   (also known as receiver) into the expression and returns the object reference on completion.
   
Note:->
=> In apply it isn’t allowed. If the property name of the data class is unique in the function,
   you can omit this.

   We should use also only when we don’t want to shadow this.
