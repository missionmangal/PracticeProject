Operators ->

Purpose of Operator->
=> The purpose of operators is to take a given data set and transform it into 
   an observable data set. 
=> Some operators can manipulate the data object and
   transform them further.


There are 3 types of Operators
1. Create Observables ->
=> Operators which are used to create obsevables
=> Operators which take Objects and produce Observables.
	create()
	fromIterable(), 
	fromArray()
	just()
	range()
	repeat()


2. Filtering & Sorting ->
=> Operators which are used to filter the dataset of observables 
	filter()
	distinct()
	take()
	takeLast()
	skip()

3. Transform emitted data into other types ->
=> As the heading suggests these type of operators are used to convert 
   emitted dataset into another dataset.
	map()
	flatMap()
	switchMap()
	buffer()
	concatMap()

Just ->
=> Just operator converts an item into an Observable that emits that item.
=> We get only one object in onNext method. Doesn't matter if there is any

From ->
=> Convert various other objects and data types into Observables.
