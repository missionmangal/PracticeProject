Disposable, DisposableObserver ,CompositeDisposable


=> If any Observer is subscribed to any Observable and on getting data from Observable it is doing some
   UI changes. Now if user moves to another screen it may reason of crashing the app.
=> To prevent from these type of problem we stop Observing the data on OnStop() or OnDestroy() method.
=> Now Disposable comes in the picture.
=> Disposable is used to stop observing.

Disposable->
=> If we create an Object of Observer we get object of Disposable in onSubscribe() method. we assign this
   object to our created instance of Disposable.
=> Now at the time of moving from one fragment to another fragment or finsing the activity we call dispose
   method of Disposable object to stop observing the data.

DisposableObserver ->
=> If we have more than one Observer then we can create DisposableObserver instead of Observer.
=> Because we can direct dispose the Observer by calling the method 'dispose()' on DisposableObserver's object.

One more problem comes now ->
If we have more than one observer and we forget to dispose any one then it can lead us to crash.

CompositeDisposable->
=> "So to overcum from this situation We use CompositeDisposable."
=> We create a object of CompositeDisposable and add Disposable or DisposableObserver to it.
=> now we can just call clear() method of CompositeDisposable to stop observing all the Observer.
