ReactiveX ->
=> ReactiveX is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs 
   by using observable sequences. 

=> It is sometimes called “functional reactive programming” but this is a misnomer.
   ReactiveX may be functional, and it may be reactive, but “functional reactive programming” 
   is a different animal. One main point of difference is that functional reactive programming 
   operates on values that change continuously over time, while ReactiveX operates on
   discrete values that are emitted over time.
