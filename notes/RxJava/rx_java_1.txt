RxJava ->

=> RxJava is java implementation for Reactive programming (Event Based Programming) 
   which in simple terms means that one part of your code would fire an Event
   (a button click, successful api response etc) 
=> while some other part of code would observe and react to that particular 
   event asynchronously (updating view, handling the api result etc).

*****RxJava vs RxAndroid****** ->

=> RxAndroid is an extension of RxJava with few added classes related to 
   Android. 
=> To be specific there are schedulers introduced in RxAndroid which
   plays a major role in supporting multi-thread operations in android. 
=> Schedulers decide if the block of code should run on a worker thread or 
   the main thread.

Observable ->

=> If you remember RxJava is Event based programming so Observable is that part of the code which fires up the event.
   You listen to observables for appropriate events.

Observer ->

=> The part of the code which listens and react to the event fired from the Observable. 
   You need to override its interface methods for the Observer to work.


Losses by using AsyncTask ->

1. Boilerplate code
2. Multithreading was a nightmare
3. More error prone
4. Memory/context leaks are easily created is an inner class and thus holds an implicit reference to the outer class
5. No error handling

Benefits -> 

1. Less code
2. Multithreading (will be explained in upcoming tutorials)
3. Minimized error occurrences
4. No memory leaks
5. And a way to handle the error at one single point(on Error()).

Methods
onSubscribe() -> 
Method will be called when an Observer subscribes to Observable.

onNext()->
This method will be called when Observable starts emitting the data.

onError()->
In case of any error, onError() method will be called.

onComplete()->
When an Observable completes the emission of all the items,
onComplete() will be called.
