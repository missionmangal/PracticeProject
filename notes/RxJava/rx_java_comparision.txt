Subscribe vs SubscribeWith ->

=> subscribe returns Disposable
=> SubscribeWith returns Observer which is provided as a parameter.

=> If we provide Observer's object as param in subscribe it'll return "Unit".
=> If we provide direct definition of onNext, onError, onComplete it'll return Disposable.

=> subscribe has many overloaded methods.
=> subscribeWith is only one method.

**************************************************************
Update value after subscribing ->
If there are multiple subscriber and we update the value which we passed 

Just ->
=>  We'll not get updated value.
   
Create,Defer ->
=> Will get updated value.
***************************************************************

Create vs Defer ->
=> The only downside to defer() is that it creates a new Observable each time you get a subscriber.
   create() can use the same function for each subscriber, so it's more efficient
