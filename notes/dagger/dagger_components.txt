Dagger main component->

1. Dependency Provider: 

=> Is the one who provide the objects that are called dependencies. 
=> The class that is responsible for providing dependencies is annotated as @Module. 
=> The methods that provides dependency(object) in this class to be annotated as @Provider.

2. Dependency Consumer:
 
=> Dependency consumer is a class where we need to instantiate the objects. 
=> But we don't need to instantiate it with the new keyword. 
=> Don't even need to get it as an argument. But dagger will provide the dependency, and for that
=> We just need to annotate the object decleration with @Inject

3. Component:

=> Acts as a interface between dependency consumer and dependency provider annotated with @Component
   and it's an interface.
