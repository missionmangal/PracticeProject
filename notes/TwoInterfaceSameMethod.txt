Two interfaces with same methods ->

Q.  Can a java class implement Two interfaces with same methods
A.  a class can implement both interface but the method will be implemented only once. 
	Which will work for both interfaces' instances.

Q.  Can a java class implement Two interfaces with same methods having the same signature but different return types??
A.	No, its an error
	If two interfaces contain a method with the same signature but different return types, then it is impossible to implement both the interface simultaneously.
