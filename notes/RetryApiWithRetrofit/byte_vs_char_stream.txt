Byte Streams v/s Char Stream

Byte Streams ->
	Java byte streams are used to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes. 
	Though there are many classes related to byte streams but the most frequently used classes are, FileInputStream and FileOutputStream.
	
Character Streams ->
	Java Byte streams are used to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes, whereas Java Character streams are used to perform input and output
	for 16-bit Unicode. Though there are many classes related to character streams but the most frequently used classes are, FileReader and FileWriter.
	Though internally FileReader uses FileInputStream and FileWriter uses FileOutputStream but here the major difference is that FileReader reads 
	two bytes at a time and FileWriter writes two bytes at a time.
